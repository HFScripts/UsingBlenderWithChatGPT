# Using Blender With ChatGPT
### Creating a virtual avatar using ChatGPT and Elvenlabs

## Prerequisites
- Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:
- Blender: Download and install the latest version of Blender from the official website (https://www.blender.org/download/)

Launch blender as Administrator and use the scripting tab to install the required tools you can simply run the install.py file inside blender.

Then edit the API keys for both openai and elvenlabs and execute the script. I would make sure for now you at least use the Windows tab on blender to show the terminal, so you can force stop the terminal with CTRL+C as it will continue listening and freeze up the blender.


What this does, it uses shape-keys to automate lip syncing. I need to add more functionality to it so for now, use it as inspiration, don't use it as is.
